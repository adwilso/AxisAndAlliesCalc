# Axis and Allies 1942 Monte Carlo Calculator
> Figures out the odds of each side winning a battle in Axis and Allies 1942, Second Edition

I'd recommend using one of the other, far better, online simulators. However, we have a running
agreement that no one will use 3rd party tools or strategy guides. So I built my own. 

## Usage example

Enter the units for the defender and attacker in the text boxes and press fight. 

## Min Set of Attackers

Enter your attacking army and the defender along with how certain you'd like to be of a win. Press "Min Set". 
the program will output the cheapest army that you can attack with and still win. Note that it will bias towards
supported infantry, as they are only slightly more expensive but a lot more powerful. . 

## Development setup

Clone the repo and open using Visual Studio. It uses WPF because I'd never used it before and it seemed worth trying out 
for a small project.
