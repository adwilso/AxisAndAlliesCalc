# Axis and Allies 1942 Monte Carlo Calculator
> Figures out the odds of each side winning a battle in Axis and Allies 1942, Second Edition

I'd recommend using one of the other, far better, online simulators. However, we have a running
agreement that no one will use 3rd party tools or strategy guides. So I built my own. 

Also, since I played as USSR, this only simulates land battles. One sub was not worth writing 
the entire naval battle engine for. However it might be interesting for other players to add it on. 

## Usage example

Enter the units for the defender and attacker in the text boxes and press fight. 

## Development setup

Clone the repo and open using Visual Studio. It uses WPF because I'd never used it before and it seemed worth trying out 
for a small project.
